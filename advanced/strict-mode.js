//strict mode in js 
"use strict";

/* just think you forget to declare a variable by var,let ,const or antything else,
 js doesnot through an error it assume it as a global variable and it is able to use inside and outside of function or any where in that files
 to remove this silly mistake we use a strict mode
 it may be declare inside a fuction block or in top of file
